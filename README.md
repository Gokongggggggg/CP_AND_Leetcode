# Algorithmic Problem Solving & Documentation


Hi there! I'm a Computer Science student at **Binus University**. In my free time, I enjoy solving algorithmic problems.

This repository serves as a personal archive and documentation of my solutions for **Competitive Programming** and **LeetCode**.

## 🚧 Current Status: Work in Progress

**Please Note:** This repository is currently undergoing a major restructuring.

* **Migration:** I am in the process of migrating and organizing my solutions. Unfortunately, some of my previous code and walkthroughs were lost, so I am rebuilding this collection from the ground up.
* **Documentation:** My goal is not just to store code, but to document the **thought process**, **intuition**, and **approach** for each problem. Many files are currently missing these explanations, but I am updating them ASAP.
